## About
This package serves as a Filament plugin template for plugins developed by DataLinx for [Eclipse](https://github.com/DataLinx/eclipsephp-app), our web app based on Filament. It is also a reference of how such a package should be configured.

The template is opinionated â€” it's based on our tech stack, which includes JetBrains PhpStorm.

This template works on and expands our [PHP package template](https://github.com/DataLinx/php-package-template).

## Requirements
- PHP >= 8.2 (due to Pest 3 requirement)

## Getting started
* Download it with composer:
```shell
  composer require eclipsephp/plugin-template
````
* _Provide a simple example how to use the package._
